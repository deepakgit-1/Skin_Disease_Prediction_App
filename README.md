# 🧴 Skin Disease Prediction App

A deep learning-based web application for predicting skin diseases using image classification. Built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed with **Streamlit**, this project aims to assist in the early detection of skin-related diseases through a user-friendly interface.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of skin lesions into different disease categories. The model is trained on the **HAM10000 dataset** from Kaggle, which contains 10,000+ dermatoscopic images across 7 types of skin diseases.

### 🔬 Skin Disease Classes
- Actinic keratoses (akiec)
- Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
- Dermatofibroma (df)
- Melanocytic nevi (nv)
- Vascular lesions (vasc)
- Melanoma (mel)
